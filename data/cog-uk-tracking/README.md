Automated analysis of ENA-submitted COG-UK data
===============================================

Purposes
--------

1. Demonstrating the feasibilty of large scale, open viral genomic surveillance data analysis with public infrastructure
2. Providing open-access to intrahost variation results for the COG-UK data

Content
-------

In this folder you'll find a regularly updated list of links to Galaxy
histories with already analyzed batches of PE-Illumina sequenced COG-UK data.

Each line in that list describes two Galaxy histories - one describing the
analysis from sequenced reads to intrahost variant calls in the form of VCFs,
the other one holding tabular and graphical variant reports for the same batch
of COG-UK data.
